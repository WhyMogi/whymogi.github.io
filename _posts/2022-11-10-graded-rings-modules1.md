# Before start

I just collected some useful theorems (at least to me) from scheme theory and sheaf cohomology theory. This post must be updated frquently. However, I assume we know \[1\] Chapter II.5. and definition of sheaf cohomology.

Usually I divide post within some categories (using headers), but I don't do that in this post.

# Start

First of all, we try to collect results in projective spaces. In most cases $X=\bP^n_A$ with ring $A$. However in most cases, we playing $X$ over field $k$ instead of $A$. 

# Convention

$A$ means ring (including field but for emphasizing ring), $k$ means field.

## Some facts of graded rings

We require several facts to understand $\Proj S$ for graded ring $S$. Here are some results (not proved). These are takin from \[2\] Section 13.1. Please see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graded_ring) for definition of graded ring. I used $\bZ$-grading.

### 1

We add more definitions. Let $S$ be a graded ring. For integer $d>0$, define
$$S^{(d)}:=\bigoplus_{n\geq 0}  S_{nd}$$
where $n$-th degree of $S^{(d)}$ is $S_{nd}$ (it is the $nd$-th degree of $S$). 

Let $M$ be a graded $A$-module. When $f\in A_d$ is a homogeneous of degree $d>0$, we define 
\\[M_{(f)}:=\\{m/f^n\in M_f\mid m\text{ is homogeneous with } \deg m=dn\\}.\\]

In short we say $M_{(f)}$ is the subgroup of $M_f$ whose degree is zero.

Given graded ring $S$, we define ideal $S_+:=\oplus_{d\geq 1} S_d$. A homogeneous prime ideal $\fp$ of $S$ is **relevant** is $A_+\not\subset \fp$. Also we write $I_+:=\oplus_{d\geq 1} I_d$.

For $n,m\geq 1$, define $A_{++}:=\bigoplus_{d\geq n} A_{dm}$. 

### 2

We collect results. Most of them are easy to prove. Let $S$ be a graded ring. Let $\fp,\fp'$ be relevant prime ideals and $\fq$ be a prime ideal. Let $I$ be a homogeneous ideal.

1. If $\fp_+=\fp'_+$, then $\fp=\fp'$.
2. Let $I$ be properly contained in $S_+$, then $I=\fp\_+$ for some homogeneous prime ideal $\fp$ of $S$ if and only if for homogeneous elements $a,b\in S_+$, $ab\in I$ implies $a\in I$ or $b\in I$.
3. We have $(\sqrt{I})_+=(\sqrt{I}) \cap A_+$.
4. $\fq$ is relevant if and only if $\fq$ doesn't contain $A_{++}$.

### 3

(This is a review of \[1\] Chapter 2.2). The set of relevant prime ideals of $S$ is written as $\Proj S$. The closed sets (satisfying the definition of topology) are given as 
$$V_+(I):=\\{\fp\in\Proj S\mid I\subset \fp\\}$$
for homogeneous ideal $I\subset A_+$. For **homogeneous** element $f\in S_+$, define
$$D_+(f):=\Proj S -V_+(f).$$

Note that $\Proj S\subset \Spec S$. It is easy to check
$$V_(\fa)\cap \Proj S=V_+(\fa^h)$$
where $\fa^h$ is a **homogeneous ideal generated** by $\fa$ (ideal generated by homogeneous component of $\fa$. Same meaning: generated by $\fa\cap S_d$ for every $d$). Thus $\Proj S$ is a subspace of $\Spec S$.

From inclusion $A_{(f)}\rightarrow A_f$, we have a continuous map 
\\[D_+(f)\hookrightarrow D(f)\rightarrow \Spec A_{(f)}\\] where the first map is the inclusion. 

## 1

(Taken from [1]. Exercise II.5.13.) Let $S=A[x_0,\cdots,x_n]$ (we can assume $S$ is a graded ring generated by $S_1$ as an $S_0$-algebra) but I think we don't have to do that case and the proof doesn't change too much.

Write $S^{(d)}:=\oplus_{n\geq 0} S_{nd}$. Roughly speaking, $S^{(d)}$ is a polynomial ring that only has degree divided by $d$. Let $X^d:\Proj S^{(d)}$ (thus $X^1=\bP^n_A$). As a scheme, $\bP^n_A\cong X^d$.

*Proof.* (Sketch) We construct $S'^d$ one more graded algebra. For $k\geq 0$, set $dk$-th degree of $S'^d$ as $S\_{dk}$ and $S'^d\_m=0$ otherwise. Then we have an isomorphism $X^d\cong \Proj S'^d$ (this is easy). Also we have an isomorphism $\Proj S'^d\cong \bP^n_A$ induced from graded ring homomorphism
\\[S_0\oplus 0\oplus\cdots\oplus S_d\oplus 0\oplus\cdots \rightarrow S_0\oplus S_1\oplus\cdots\oplus S_d\oplus S_{d+1}\oplus\cdots\\]
given as the inclusion. $\square$
