# Before start

*There was a post with title "K3 Surfaces (3)" but I removed it from my blog. You can find it on my github repository. It is in .txt file but (almost every) content is in this post.*

A post abouot $K3$ surface. I try to write technical details in other post. I try to follow \[1\] and a lecture note \[2\] (order of topics came from \[2\] but content might come from \[1\]).

# Convention

Usually $k$ means a field (not necessarily algebraically closed).

**Variety** over $k$ means a separated, geometrically integral scheme of finite type over $k$.

I mostly write divisor for Weil divisor. If it is a Cartier divisor, then I indicate it.

# Start

## Definition & Examples

### 1 

An **algebraic** $K3$ **surface** over $k$ is a nonsingular variety $X$ (with structure sheaf $O_X$) of dimension $2$ that satisfies

- $\omega_X=O_X$ and
- $H^1(X,O_X)=0$.

where $\omega_X$ is a canonical sheaf of $X$ (or known as $\wedge^2 \Omega_{X/k}$ or $K_X$).

**Note.** I mainly discuss algebraic $K3$ surface instead of $K3$ surface from complex geometry. I will write $K3$ surface instead of algebraic $K3$ surface. If I want to discuss in complex geometry, I will distinguish them.

### 2

We derive several easy things from the definition.

#### 2.1

The rank of $\omega_X=O_X$ is $1$. Thus we can associate divisor $K_X$ to $\omega_X$ (up to equivalence. By using identification of divisor classes and the group of line bundles (or called **Picard group**)).

I only write $K_X$ for divisor not for canonical sheaf.

#### 2.2

The rank of $\Omega_X$ is $2$ because the rank of $\omega_X=\wedge^2 \Omega_X$ is $1={\rank\Omega_X\choose 2}$.

#### 2.3

From rank of $\Omega_X$ is $2$, we have a (natural) pairing $\Omega_X\times \Omega_X\rightarrow \omega_X$. 

---
*Remark this fact:* Let $\cF$ be a locally free sheaf of rank $n$. Then there is a map 
\\[\wedge^r \cF \otimes_{O_X} \wedge^{n-r}\cF\rightarrow \wedge^n \cF\\]
such that 
\\[\wedge^r \cF\rightarrow (\wedge^{n-r} \cF)^\vee\otimes_{O_X} \wedge^n \cF\\]
is an isomorphism. (see \[3\] Section 7.5 then solve \[3\] Exercise 7.27 and 7.28)

---

Then we can write the tangent sheaf of $X$ by
\\[\cT_X:=\Omega_X^\vee=\cHom(\Omega_X, O_X)\cong \Omega_X.\\]

#### 2.4

Remark that smooth **complete** ($X$ is complete if $X\rightarrow \Spec k$ is proper) surface is projective. Because we are playing on scheme over $k$, any $K3$ surface is projective.

#### 2.5

Variety $X$ over field $k$ is irreducible hence connected. Using $H^0(X,O_X)$ is a finite dimensional $k$-veector space (see \[4\] Theorem II.5.19.) and it doesn't have nontrivial idempotent, it should be $k$.

### 2.6

An **abelian surface** is an **abelian variety** of dimension $2$. In detail it is a variety of dimension $2$ that satisfies equivalent statement

- A connected and complete algebraic group over $k$.
- A connected and projective algebraic group over $k$.

It is known that given abelian surface $A$, we have $A(k)=k^2/\Gamma$ where $\Gamma$ is a lattice of $k^2$ (See \[6\] Proposition I.2.1)

### 2.7 

Let $X$ be a variety over $\overline{k}$ (algebraic closure of $k$) if $\Spec \widehat{O_{X,p}}$ is isomorphic to the completion of the curve $\Spec \overline{k}[x,y]/(f(x,y))$ where $f$ is a homogeneous polynomial of degree $m$ without repeated roots, we say $X$ has an **ordinary multiple point of multiplicity** $m$. When $m=2$, we say $X$ has a (**ordinary**) **double point** at $p$. 

### 3

Here are some examples of $K3$ surfaces. In here, we review several algebraic geometry facts.

#### 3.1

Let $X\subset \bP^3$ be a smooth **quartic** (defined by single irreducible polynomial whose degree is $4$). We claim $X$ is a $K3$ surface.

The first cohomology of $H^1(X,O_X)$ comes from short exact sequence

\\[0\rightarrow O(-4)\xrightarrow{\times f} O\rightarrow i_*O_X\rightarrow 0 \\]
where $i:X\rightarrow \bP^3$ is an inclusion.

The **adjunction formula** (see \[4\] Proposition II.8.20.) says
\\[\omega_X=(\omega_{\bP^3}\otimes O(4))|\_{O\_X}= (O(-4)\otimes O(4))|\_{O\_X}=O_X\\]
(see \[4\] Example II.8.20.1 for calculation of canonical sheaf of $\bP^n$)

#### 3.2

(Generalization of **3.1** case) Let $n\geq 0$ and $X=\bP^{n+2}$. Let $S$ be a **complete intersection** (the homogeneous ideal $I$ of $S$ is generated by the number of codimension of $S$ in $X$ with elements in $A:=k[x_0,\cdots,x_{n+2}]$) given as $V(f_1,\cdots,f_n)$ with homogeneous element $f_i\in A$. 

We have a formula (it can be derived from the adjunction formula. \[3\] Example II.8.20.3, Exercise II.8.4. give a more discussion) 
$$\omega_S= O_X\bigg(-n-1+\sum_i \deg f_i \bigg)\Bigg\vert_S.$$

Furthermore we have an exact sequence (from closed subscheme)
$$0\rightarrow \cI_1+\cdots \cI_n \rightarrow O_X\rightarrow i_*O_S$$
where $\cI_i=O(-\deg f_i)$ is the ideal sheaf of closed subscheme $V(f_i)$ of $X$. Set
\\[M:=\sum_i \deg f_i\\]

Remark this fact (see \[4\] Section III.5 but I prefer \[5\] Theorem 18.1.3.) 

 - If $m\geq 0$, then $H^0(X,O(m))$ is a free $k$-module with rank ${n+m \choose m}$.
- If $m\leq -n-1$, then $H^n(X,O(m))$ is a free $k$-module with rank ${-m-1 \choose -n-m-1}$
- Otherwese, $H^r(X,O(m))=0$.

(this is true when $k$ is changed into noethrian ring $A$ with $X=\bP^n_A$)

Then we have
$H^1(X,O_X(-M))=0$ if and only if $M=n+3$.

Then one can check $S$ is a $K3$ surface if and only if $M=n+3$.

#### 3.3

(Kummer surface but I don't define Kummer surface in here. I don't know general definition of Kummer surface) 

Let characteristic of $k$ is not $2$. Let $A$ be an **abelian surface** over $k$. It is an **abelian variety** (a complete connected group variety) with dimension $2$. Consider involution $\sigma:A\rightarrow A$, $a\mapsto -a$.

It is known that there are $16$ two torsion points (equivalently fixed points of involution). 

We blow up $\pi: A'\rightarrow A$ with fixed points. Note that the involution $\sigma:A\rightarrow A$ induces $\sigma':A'\rightarrow A'$ (from universal property of blowup).

Define $A/\sigma$ as the quotient of $A$ with the kernel of $\sigma$ (it is a fixed point). Similarly, define $A'/\sigma'$ similarly. Then we have a commutative diagram

![cd1](/assets/1106_1.png)

Because there are $16$ double points, there are $16$ **exceptional curves** (meaning curve $C$ such that $C^2:=C\cdot C=-1$. See heading 2.5 of [here](/_posts/2022-11-04-curves1.md) for the definition of dot product). Each exceptional curve is a blow up of some point.

With this construction, we claim $X$ is a $K3$ surface. I divided it in steps.

We write $A[2]$ for $2$-torsion points of $A$ (same as fixed points. Anyway there are $16$ points).

##### $X$ is smooth

Note that $X$ is smooth at everywhere except exceptional divisors. A good news is, we don't have to check smoothness at every $16$ curves. For $a\in A[2]$, let $\tau_a:A\rightarrow A$ be a translation by $a$ (sending $x$ to $x+a$). It is easy to check 
\\[\tau_a\circ \sigma=\sigma\circ\tau_a:A\rightarrow A.\\]
This implies the $16$ curves translate each other (with suitable element $a'\in A'$) and we only have to check  Note that we have very trivial point $0\in A$.

We assume $U=\Spec k[x,y]/I$ for some ideal $I$ of $k[x,y]$. Our claim is there is a local coordinate on $X$. Quick calculation gives \\[\Bl_0(A)=V(xv'-yu')\subset \bA^2\times \bP^1\\]
where $u',v'$ are local coordinate of $\bP^1$. On complement of $V(u')$, we write $u:=u'/v'$. Then we have local coordinate $y,u$ on $A'$. Note that $\sigma'$ acts as
\\[\sigma'(y)=-y,\quad\sigma'(u)=\sigma'(x/y)=x/y=u.\\]
This shows the local coordinate of $X$ is given as $y^2$ and $u$. This proves $X$ is smooth.

##### $X$ is $K3$ surface

Given exceptional curves $E_i$ and a morphism $\pi:A'\rightarrow S$ from the diagram, we have 
\\[\omega_{A'}\cong O(\sum E_i),\\]
(see \[4\] Proposition V.3.3 and use [tangent sheaf of abelian variety is trivial](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/73824/abelian-variety-and-tangent-bundle-reference-request)) and
\\[\omega_{A'}\cong \pi^*\omega_{S}\otimes O(\sum_i E_i)\\]

From morphism $O_X\rightarrow \pi_*O_{A'}$,




Then we have $\pi^*\omega_{X}=O_{A'}$.
