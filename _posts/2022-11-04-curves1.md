# Before start

I try to write some pictures what is happening instead of writing a bunch of proof. I am (really) bad at English. Some sentences are not clear and there might be grammar issue. I didn't make 'comment' section. I will write my contact info later.

In this post, I assume we know upto chapter III.4 of [1] (just knowing definitions is fine)

# Goal

Given surface $S$, we want to check properties of intersection of two curves.

I followed a part of chapter IV and V of [1]. I will make a post about 'good' curves so some statements are not proved.

# Conventions

**Variety** means integral scheme over field $k$ whose structure morphism $X\rightarrow \Spec k$ is separated and of finite type. **Surface** means a nonsingular projective variety over an algebraically closed field whose dimension is $2$ and **curve** means any effective (Weil) divisor of given surface. Usually, I write $S$ for surface and $C,D$ for curves. Before start remark there is a one to one bijection between

- Line bundles over surface $S$, 
- Equivalent class of Cartier divisors of $S$, and
- The **divisor class group** (equivalent class of Weil divisors of $S$).

(This is true for any noetherian, integral, separated locally factorial scheme $S$)

# Reference
I don't want to write references in formal way. To clarify, I added link.
