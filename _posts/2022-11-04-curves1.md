# Before start

I try to write some pictures what is happening instead of writing a bunch of proof. I am (really) bad at English. Some sentences are not clear and there might be grammar issue. I didn't make 'comment' section. I will write my contact info later.

In this post, I assume we know upto chapter III.4 of \[1\] (just knowing definitions is fine)

# Goal

Given surface $S$, we want to check properties of intersection of two curves.

I followed a part of chapter IV and V of \[1\]. I will make a post about 'good' curves so some statements are not proved.

# Conventions, Facts

**Variety** means integral scheme over field $k$ whose structure morphism $X\rightarrow \Spec k$ is separated and of finite type. (Sometimes 'integral' condition can be changed into 'geometrically integral' but not in this note)

**Surface** means a nonsingular projective variety over an algebraically closed field whose dimension is $2$.

**Curve** means any effective (Weil) divisor of given surface. Usually, I write $S$ for surface and $C,D$ for curves. **Divisor** means Weil divisor and I will indicate **Cartier** divisor if I discuss about it.

**Point** of variety means closed point. If point is not closed, I will mention this.

Before start remark there is a one to one bijection between ($S$ is a surface)

- Line bundles on $S$, and
- The **divisor class group** (equivalent class of Weil divisors on $S$) on $S$.

where divisor $D$ on $S$ corresponds to line bundle $O_S(D)$. This is true for any noetherian, integral, separated locally factorial scheme $S$. For detail, see [1] Chapter II.6.

Recall Cartier divisor $D$ is effective if and only if $\cJ_X(D)$ is an ideal of $O_X$. We write $D$ for corresponding closed subscheme of $S$ defined by $\cJ_X(D)$. Given closed immersion $i:D\rightarrow X$, 
\\[(O_X/\cJ_X(D))|_D:=i^{-1}(O_X/\cJ_X(D))=O_D\\]
is a structure sheaf of $D$ and the pushforward of $O_D$ is same as $O_X/\cJ_X(D)$.

Abusing notation, we consider $O_D$ as a sheaf on $X$. It is pushforward of the $O_D$. Similarly, when there is a morphism $f:X\rightarrow Y$ of scheme, we consider $O_Y$-module $\cF$ as an $O_X$-module by pullback (so it means $f^*\cF$). Sheaf of differential usually written in this way. 

# Start

## Intersection number

We investigate 'good' definitions and properties.

### 1

Consider $S=\bP^2$ (with coordinate $[t:x:y]$) and $C=V(x)$, $D=V(y)$ be curves in $S$. As a set $C\cap D$ is a singleton (namely $[1:0:0]$). When we set curves $C=V(x^2)$, $D=V(y^2)$, $C\cap D$ is also a singleton. As a set, intersection number seems to be $1$ for both cases however we want to count multiplicity.

One good way to count multiplicity is checking on stalks (roughly speaking playing it on affine plane). Let $p=[1:0:0]$ and $Z=C\cap D$ be a closed subscheme of $S$ (of course it has more information than set $\{p\}$) for each cases and 
\\[R:=O_{Z,p}.\\]
When $C=V(x)$ and $D=V(y)$, $R=k$. When $C=x^2$ and $D=y^2$, $R=(k[x,y]/(x^2,y^2))_{(x,y)}$. In the second case, $R$ is a vector space over $k$ whose dimension $4$.

In general (in surface $S$ and curves $C$ and $D$), $C$ and $D$ meet **transversally** at $p\in C\cap D$ if local equation $f$ of $C$ and $g$ of $D$ generate the maximal ideal of $O_{S,p}$. In the example, $C=V(x)$ and $D=V(y)$ meet transversally, but $C=V(x^2)$ and $D=V(y^2)$ don't meet transversally.

In general, given surface $S$ and curves $C,D$, the definition of **intersection number** of curves is \\[C\cdot D:=\sum_{x\in C\cap D}m_x(C,D)\\]
where $m_x(C,D)$ is the dimension of $k$-vector space $O_{S,x}/(f,g)$ where $f$ and $g$ are local equations of $C$ and $D$, respectively.

### 2

We associate above with line bundle. If $C=V(f)\subset \bP^n$ is a curve of **degree** $d$ (meaning $f$ is a homogeneous polynomial of degree $d$ and we will define it in genral setting), then the ideal sheaf of $C$ is $O_X(d)$. (Hint: consider exact sequence \\[0\rightarrow A(-d)\xrightarrow{\times f} A\rightarrow A/(d)\rightarrow 0 \\]
where $A=k[x_0,\cdots,x_n]$). 

Note that the dimension of $O\_{S,x}/(f,g)$ (as a $k$-vector space) is same as the dimension of $k$-vector space $\Gamma(C\cap D,O\_{C\cap D})$. Our quick calculation gives \\[\begin{aligned*}C\cdot D &=h^0(O_{C\cap D})\\ &= \chi(O_{C\cap D}) \\&=\chi(O_C)-\chi(O_C(-D))\\ &= \chi(O_S)-\chi(O_S(-C))-\chi(O_S(-D))+\chi(O_S(-C-D))\end{aligned}\\]
where $h^i(\cF)$ is $\dim_k H^i(S,\cF)$ and $\chi(\cF)$ is given as \\[\sum_i(-1)^ih^i(\cF).\\]

The proof is observing these exact sequences.

\\[0\rightarrow O_C(-D)\rightarrow O_C\rightarrow O_{C\cap D}\rightarrow 0,\\]
\\[0\rightarrow O_S(-C)\rightarrow O_S\rightarrow O_{C}\rightarrow 0,\\]
and
\\[0\rightarrow O_S(-C-D)\rightarrow O_S(-D)\rightarrow O_{C}(-D)\rightarrow 0.\\]

In general if we have line bundles $\cL,\cL'$ on $S$, then we define

\\[\cL\cdot \cL':=\chi(O_S)-\chi(\cL^\vee)-\chi(\cL'^\vee) +\chi(\cL^\vee\otimes (\cL')^\vee).\\]

For example:
Let $S=\bP^2$ as usual. $\chi(O_S)=1$, $\chi(O_S(1))=3$, $\chi(O_S(-1))=0$, $\chi(O_S(2))=6$, $\chi(O_S(-2))=0$, $\chi(O_S(-4))=3$. I introduce useful theorem later for this.

1. When $C=V(x)$ and $D=V(y)$, then $O_C=O_X(1)=O_D$. The direct caculation with line bundle gives $O_C\cdot O_D=1=C\cdot D$.

2. When $C=V(x^2)$ and $D=V(y^2)$, then $O_C=O_X(2)=O_D$. The direct caculation with line bundle gives $O_C\cdot O_D=4=C\cdot D$.

### 2.5

(Very useful theorem for cohomology of line bundles on projective space)

It can be found in \[1\] but \[2\] is more easy to see.

I don't want to write references in formal way. To clarify, I added link.
