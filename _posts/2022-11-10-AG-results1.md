# Before start

I just collected some useful theorems (at least to me) from scheme theory and sheaf cohomology theory. This post must be updated frquently. However, I assume we know \[1\] Chapter II.5. and definition of sheaf cohomology.

Usually I divide post within some categories (using headers), but I don't do that in this post.

# Start

First of all, we try to collect results in projective spaces. In most cases $X=\bP^n_A$ with ring $A$. However in most cases, we playing $X$ over field $k$ instead of $A$. 

# Convention

$A$ means ring (including field but for emphasizing ring), $k$ means field.

## Some facts of graded rings

We require several facts to understand $\Proj S$ for graded ring $S$. Here are some results (not proved). These are takin from \[2\] Section 13.1. Please see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graded_ring) for definition of graded ring.

### 1
We add more definitions. Let $S$ be a graded ring. For integer $d>0$, define
$$S^{(d)}:=\bigoplus_{n\geq 0}  S_{nd}$$
where $n$-th degree of $S^{(d)}$ is $S_{nd}$. 

Let $M$ be a graded $A$-module. When $f\in A_d$ is a homogeneous of degree $d>0$, we define 
\\[M_{(f)}:=\{m/f^n\in M_f\mid m\text{ is homogeneous with } \deg m=dn\}\\]


## 1

(Taken from [1]. Exercise II.5.13.) Let $S=A[x_0,\cdots,x_n]$ (we can assume $S$ is a graded ring generated by $S_1$ as an $S_0$-algebra) but I think we don't have to do that case and the proof doesn't change too much.

Write $S^{(d)}:=\oplus_{n\geq 0} S_{nd}$. Roughly speaking, $S^{(d)}$ is a polynomial ring that only has degree divided by $d$. Let $X^d:\Proj S^{(d)}$ (thus $X^1=\bP^n_A$). As a scheme, $\bP^n_A\cong X^d$.

*Proof.* (Sketch) We construct $S'^d$ one more graded algebra. For $k\geq 0$, set $dk$-th degree of $S'^d$ as $S\_{dk}$ and $S'^d\_m=0$ otherwise. Then we have an isomorphism $X^d\cong \Proj S'^d$ (this is easy). Also we have an isomorphism $\Proj S'^d\cong \bP^n_A$ induced from graded ring homomorphism
\\[S_0\oplus 0\oplus\cdots\oplus S_d\oplus 0\oplus\cdots \rightarrow S_0\oplus S_1\oplus\cdots\oplus S_d\oplus S_{d+1}\oplus\cdots\\]
given as the inclusion. $\square$



# Reference

I don't want to write references in formal way. To clarify, I added link.
